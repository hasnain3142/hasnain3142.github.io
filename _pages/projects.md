        <h3>SmartScan Billing Assistant</h3>
        <span class="timeline">May 2024 - Jul 2024</span>
        </div>
        <p>The SmartScan Billing Assistant is a computer vision-based project designed to automate the process of calculating the total bill by detecting products and adding their prices using a camera, similar to a cashier. This project uses the YOLOv8 model for object detection and tracking. This is the MVP of the main project I did for a supermarket where I implemented the SmartScan billing system on more than 1200 products.</p>
